        """

        The client class that connects to and accesses AWS IoT over MQTT v3.1/3.1.1.

        The following connection types are available:

        - TLSv1.2 Mutual Authentication

        X.509 certificate-based secured MQTT connection to AWS IoT

        - Websocket SigV4

        IAM credential-based secured MQTT connection over Websocket to AWS IoT

        It provides basic synchronous MQTT operations in the classic MQTT publish-subscribe
        model, along with configurations of on-top features:

        - Auto reconnect/resubscribe

        - Progressive reconnect backoff

        - Offline publish requests queueing with draining
